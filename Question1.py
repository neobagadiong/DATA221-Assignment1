Question 1: Controlled Multiplication Loop

Write a Python program that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product first
becomes greater than a given threshold value.
Your program should:
    • Store the threshold value in a variable.
    • Keep track of the current multiplier.
    • Print the final product and the integer that caused the product to exceed the threshold.

'''

# Example structure given 
threshold = 1000
currentNumber = 1
product = 1

# Start of written code/loop logic
while product < threshold:
    currentNumber += 1
    product = product * currentNumber

#Printout of result
print (product, 'is the final product, exceeded threshold when multiplied last with', currentNumber)
